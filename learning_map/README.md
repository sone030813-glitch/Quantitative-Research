# External Research Resources

## üìò Quant Reading Lists
1. **[Quant-Reading-List (SJTU-DMTai)](https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/Quant-Reading-List)**
   - Organized collection of academic papers in AI + Quant Finance.
   - Covers factors, machine learning, portfolio optimization, and recent research.
   - üìà I will review these papers year by year to stay current with the field.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quant Developer Resources
2. **[Quant-Developers-Resources (cybergeekgyan)](https://github.com/cybergeekgyan/Quant-Developers-Resources)**
   - Resources for quantitative developers and researchers.
   - Includes math, coding, statistics, and finance fundamentals.
   - üéØ Goal: Master both research theory and implementation.

### üß© My Learning Plan
1. Read papers from *Quant-Reading-List* and summarize in `research_tree/foundation/`.

| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| ü•á 1 | **Time-Series Forecasting**                                           | Core skill for all FX and CTA modeling. Used to predict returns, trends, and volatility ‚Äî the foundation of systematic trading.                        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       |
| ü•à 2 | **Online Learning**                                                   | Markets change fast ‚Äî static models decay. Online learning allows models to adapt dynamically and stay robust under regime shifts.                     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       |
| ü•â 3 | **Explainable AI (XAI)**                                              | ML models are powerful but often black-box. XAI provides interpretability ‚Äî essential for research credibility, risk control, and PhD-level reasoning. | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | **In-Sample Learning**                                                | Classic machine-learning base: trees, neural networks, feature selection. Builds intuition for time-series and adaptive learning methods.              | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê        |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | **MICSSC (Multivariate Information-Coupled Cross-Sectional Context)** | A frontier direction combining cross-sectional and time-series modeling ‚Äî the next generation of factor and macro modeling.                            | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê        |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£  | **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**                                       | Captures relationships among assets (correlations, sectors, macro links). Valuable but secondary for FX/CTA work right now.                            | ‚≠ê‚≠ê         |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£  | **Large Language Models (LLM)**                                       | Alternative-data frontier ‚Äî using NLP for news, reports, and sentiment analysis in macro/FX. Promising but best studied later.                         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê         |

2. Follow *Quant-Developers-Resources* to strengthen coding and math.
3. Combine both paths ‚Üí build my own quant project in `quantitative_research/`.
