# External Research Resources

## 📘 Quant Reading Lists
1. **[Quant-Reading-List (SJTU-DMTai)](https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/Quant-Reading-List)**
   - Organized collection of academic papers in AI + Quant Finance.
   - Covers factors, machine learning, portfolio optimization, and recent research.
   - 📈 I will review these papers year by year to stay current with the field.

## ⚙️ Quant Developer Resources
2. **[Quant-Developers-Resources (cybergeekgyan)](https://github.com/cybergeekgyan/Quant-Developers-Resources)**
   - Resources for quantitative developers and researchers.
   - Includes math, coding, statistics, and finance fundamentals.
   - 🎯 Goal: Master both research theory and implementation.

### 🧩 My Learning Plan
1. Read papers from *Quant-Reading-List* and summarize in `research_tree/foundation/`.

| #    | Theme                                                                 | Why It Matters                                                                                                                                         | Importance |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| 🥇 1 | **Time-Series Forecasting**                                           | Core skill for all FX and CTA modeling. Used to predict returns, trends, and volatility — the foundation of systematic trading.                        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| 🥈 2 | **Online Learning**                                                   | Markets change fast — static models decay. Online learning allows models to adapt dynamically and stay robust under regime shifts.                     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| 🥉 3 | **Explainable AI (XAI)**                                              | ML models are powerful but often black-box. XAI provides interpretability — essential for research credibility, risk control, and PhD-level reasoning. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| 4️⃣  | **In-Sample Learning**                                                | Classic machine-learning base: trees, neural networks, feature selection. Builds intuition for time-series and adaptive learning methods.              | ⭐⭐⭐        |
| 5️⃣  | **MICSSC (Multivariate Information-Coupled Cross-Sectional Context)** | A frontier direction combining cross-sectional and time-series modeling — the next generation of factor and macro modeling.                            | ⭐⭐⭐        |
| 6️⃣  | **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**                                       | Captures relationships among assets (correlations, sectors, macro links). Valuable but secondary for FX/CTA work right now.                            | ⭐⭐         |
| 7️⃣  | **Large Language Models (LLM)**                                       | Alternative-data frontier — using NLP for news, reports, and sentiment analysis in macro/FX. Promising but best studied later.                         | ⭐⭐         |

2. Follow *Quant-Developers-Resources* to strengthen coding and math.
3. Combine both paths → build my own quant project in `quantitative_research/`.
