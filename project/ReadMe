# 🧩 Multi-Asset Quantitative Research & Trading System

> 📈 A complete, step-by-step framework for building a multi-asset trading system — from data to live trading.  
> Combines **financial data engineering**, **Transformer-based forecasting**, and **quantitative backtesting**.

---


### **Stage 1 · Data Acquisition & Cleaning**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Collect and clean reliable **15-minute market data** (gold, copper, crude oil, silver, etc.)

**Tasks**
- Download data using `yfinance` or `AkShare`
- Align timestamps across all assets
- Remove missing values / outliers
- Save unified CSV or pickle files

**Deliverables**
- `data/gold_15m.csv`, `data/copper_15m.csv`, ...
- Script: `data_loader.py`

**Next →** Stage 2: Feature Engineering

---

### **Stage 2 · Feature Engineering**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Convert raw OHLCV into model-ready features.

**Tasks**
- Calculate technical indicators (MA, RSI, MACD, volatility)
- Add cross-asset ratios (Gold/Silver, Oil/Gold)
- Normalize and standardize all features
- Split into train / validation / test sets

**Deliverables**
- `feature_engineering.py`
- `features_15m.pkl` (cleaned, merged feature set)

**Next →** Stage 3: Backtesting Framework

---

### **Stage 3 · Backtesting Framework**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Build and validate a working trading simulation environment.

**Tasks**
- Install and configure `Backtrader` or `vectorbt`
- Implement a simple baseline strategy (MA cross / RSI)
- Run historical backtest and verify data integration
- Generate PnL curve, Sharpe, max drawdown

**Deliverables**
- `backtest/simple_ma_strategy.py`
- Backtest plots and performance summary

**Next →** Stage 4: Modeling & Prediction

---

### **Stage 4 · Modeling & Prediction**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Train machine learning models to predict short-term price movements.

**Tasks**
- Start with basic ML (XGBoost / MLP)
- Extend to Transformer / LSTM architectures
- Predict next-step returns or up/down probability
- Save outputs to `predictions/`

**Deliverables**
- `models/train_model.py`
- `predictions/gold_signals.csv`

**Next →** Stage 5: Signal Generation & Execution

---

### **Stage 5 · Signal Generation & Execution**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Translate model predictions into actionable buy/sell signals.

**Tasks**
- Apply thresholds (e.g. >0.6 = buy, <0.4 = sell)
- Smooth noisy predictions / add cooldown periods
- Integrate with backtesting engine
- Evaluate model-driven trading performance

**Deliverables**
- `strategies/model_signal_strategy.py`
- Updated backtest performance

**Next →** Stage 6: Ensemble Modeling

---

### **Stage 6 · Ensemble Modeling & Bayesian Fusion**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Stabilize predictions by combining multiple models.

**Tasks**
- Gather probabilities from several models (Transformer, LSTM, XGBoost)
- Fuse them using Bayesian log-odds or Stacking (Logistic Regression)
- Output final unified probability `P_final`
- Feed ensemble result into trading system

**Deliverables**
- `ensemble/ensemble_fusion.py`
- `fused_signals.csv`

**Next →** Stage 7: Portfolio Optimization

---

### **Stage 7 · Portfolio Optimization & Risk Control**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Optimize multi-asset capital allocation to smooth performance.

**Tasks**
- Estimate expected returns & covariance matrix
- Apply Mean-Variance or Risk Parity optimization
- Account for transaction costs & drawdown limits
- Backtest multi-asset strategy results

**Deliverables**
- `portfolio_optimizer.py`
- Portfolio PnL curve and report

**Next →** Stage 8: Evaluation & Visualization

---

### **Stage 8 · Evaluation & Visualization**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Evaluate system performance quantitatively and visually.

**Tasks**
- Compute metrics: Annual Return, Sharpe, Max Drawdown, Turnover
- Plot equity curve & rolling Sharpe
- Compare baseline vs ML vs ensemble
- Document results

**Deliverables**
- `analysis/visualize_results.py`
- `results/summary_report.md`

**Next →** Stage 9: (Optional) Live / Paper Trading

---

### **Stage 9 · Live / Paper Trading (Advanced)**

**🎯 Goal:**  
Deploy the strategy to a live or paper-trading environment.

**Tasks**
- Connect to broker APIs (MT5 / Binance / IBKR)
- Stream real-time data and generate live signals
- Log executions and update models periodically
- Build monitoring dashboard

**Deliverables**
- `live_trading_bot.py`
- Real-time logs and dashboard
